Traveling Salesman with hill climbing

The travelling salesman problem is as follows: A salesman has to visit a set of cities. Find the shortest path for the salesman that visits each city exactly once and then returns to the starting point.

At each stage of the hill-climbing, you have to consider swaps between all pairs of cities. Therefore, if there are N cities, you have to consider N(N-1)/2 swaps.
